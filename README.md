# JavaScript Course Practice Repo

A personal practice repository for learning core JavaScript through small, focused HTML/JS exercises and mini-projects.

## What is in this repo

This repo contains lesson-by-lesson files and standalone exercises that cover:

- JavaScript basics (variables, booleans, functions, objects)
- DOM manipulation and events
- Arrays and loops
- Higher-order array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `every`, `some`)
- Async JavaScript (`XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, `async/await`, Promises)
- Browser persistence with `localStorage`

## Project structure

- `04-website.html` to `19-promise.html` / `19-promise.js`: main lesson files
- `Exercises/`: additional exercise files and challenge implementations
- `javascript-array-functions-practice/`: dedicated array-method worksheet + prompt README
- `images/`: assets used by UI projects (for example, Rock-Paper-Scissors)

## Highlights

- Rock-Paper-Scissors projects with score persistence via `localStorage`
- Calculator and DOM-based interaction exercises
- Async networking examples in `18-lesson18.html`
- Promise examples in `19-promise.js`
- Array function drill in `javascript-array-functions-practice/`

## How to run

No build step or package install is required.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open any `.html` file directly in a browser.
3. Open DevTools Console to view JavaScript output for console-based exercises.

Optional (recommended): run with a local static server (for example, VS Code Live Server) for smoother file navigation.

## Notes

- This is a practice repository, so many files are intentionally small and focused.
- Naming is lesson-oriented rather than app-oriented by design.
